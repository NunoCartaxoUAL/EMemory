# EMemory
## Description
After reasearching and learning the basics of composables, i wanted to make a simple app so i decided a memo app would be a good Idead, I have used kotlin before but its the first time i use composables to build an app.

## Objective
- Learn more kotlin
- Practice more kotlin
- use Jetpack Compose for the first time
- Make the theme simple to be able to finish it

## Flaws
Along the way, I faced a few hiccups. First off, file names had to be unique, which caused a bit of confusion. There were also moments where I felt certain parts of the app could be more efficient. Plus, users mentioned they needed clearer instructions on how to use the app effectively.
- It saves to / and reads from , files which could lead to a few problems with reading the file and etc.
- The file names need to be unique and it has no warning for it
- Should give the user maybe a bit more information on its operation
- Some things could be made alot more efficient but for the porpuse of this app i left it like that
- not alot of comments since i just made it to learn

## Conclusion
"Composables are really good tools for Android development. Implementing things was straightforward. Overall, even though there are things i could improve , I'm pleased with the simple app I made.
